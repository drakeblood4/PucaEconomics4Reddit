Please if testing this code don't DDoS PucaTrades servers. That seems like a rood dood move. 

You'll need to manually log in to PucaTrade in the Selenium browser in order to run this code

Also, if you want to independantly test without using my data, delete pu_data.json

Also^2, you'll need to update Line 9 of pucaactivity.py to the location of your geckodriver in order to run this code
